📦 TD-EduPack

TD-EduPack is a collection of TouchDesigner templates created for first-year RMIT Vietnam design students who are completely new to node-based interactive systems.
This pack provides simple, beginner-friendly .tox and .toe files that help students explore fundamental concepts in TouchDesigner without needing to start from scratch.

The goal is to offer an easy, accessible, and ready-to-use starting point for learning generative design, interactive visuals, and real-time media experimentation.
